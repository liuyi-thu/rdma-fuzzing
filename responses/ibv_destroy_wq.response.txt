Based on the provided options, several classes for generating code for `ibv_destroy_wq` are available. These implementations are similar but slightly vary in comment descriptions and code structure. The primary difference lies in the comments used in the `generate_c` method. 

Here's a choice of the most consistent and concise option based on your existing code style:

```python
class DestroyWQ(VerbCall):
    """Destroy a Work Queue (WQ)."""
    
    def __init__(self, wq_addr: str):
        self.wq_addr = wq_addr

    @classmethod
    def from_trace(cls, info: str, ctx: CodeGenContext):
        kv = _parse_kv(info)
        wq = kv.get("wq", "unknown")
        ctx.use_wq(wq)  # Ensure the WQ is used before generating code
        return cls(wq_addr=wq)

    def generate_c(self, ctx: CodeGenContext) -> str:
        wq_name = ctx.get_wq(self.wq_addr)
        return f"""
    /* ibv_destroy_wq */
    if (ibv_destroy_wq({wq_name})) {{
        fprintf(stderr, "Failed to destroy WQ\\n");
        return -1;
    }}
"""
```

### Explanation:
- The class description `"Destroy a Work Queue (WQ)."` is brief and consistent with other class descriptions in your code.
- The `ibv_destroy_wq` function usage is adequately commented.
- Error handling is similar to your existing implemented code, with an appropriate error message inside an `fprintf` statement.
- It also follows your code style by ensuring the work queue is marked as used in the context with `ctx.use_wq(wq)` in the `from_trace` method.

You can incorporate this snippet into your `verbs.py` file to generate the C code for destroying a work queue.
