Here's the selected and slightly adjusted version of the `IncRKey` class that fits well into your existing `verbs.py` structure. This implementation balances clarity and functionality:

```python
class IncRKey(VerbCall):
    """Verb to increment the rkey value."""

    def __init__(self, rkey: str):
        self.rkey = rkey

    @classmethod
    def from_trace(cls, info: str, ctx: CodeGenContext):
        kv = _parse_kv(info)
        rkey = kv.get("rkey", "unknown")
        return cls(rkey=rkey)

    def generate_c(self, ctx: CodeGenContext) -> str:
        return f"""
    /* ibv_inc_rkey */
    uint32_t new_rkey = ibv_inc_rkey({self.rkey});
    fprintf(stdout, "Old RKey: %u, New RKey: %u\\n", {self.rkey}, new_rkey);
"""

# Add the new verb to the VERB_FACTORY
VERB_FACTORY["ibv_inc_rkey"] = IncRKey.from_trace
```

### Explanation:
1. **Class Name and Method Description**: Used `IncRKey` for clarity and consistency with other class naming conventions in your script. The class contains a short docstring describing its purpose.

2. **Old RKey**: Initialized using the provided input or defaults to `"unknown"` if not specified.

3. **Code Generation (`generate_c` Method)**:
   - It generates a comment for the operation.
   - It defines a new variable `new_rkey` that stores the result of the `ibv_inc_rkey` function call.
   - It logs the old and new rkey values using `fprintf` with `stdout`.

This structure will integrate seamlessly with the existing setup, and the comment provides clarification on the operation performed. To integrate this into your codebase successfully, ensure you paste it into `verbs.py` and add it to the `VERB_FACTORY`.
